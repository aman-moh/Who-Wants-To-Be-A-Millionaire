#Intent
*"Every journey begins with the first step of articulating the intention, and then becoming the intention.‚Äù - Bryant McGill, Voice of Reason*

The intention of this project is to create something that touches all areas of my current skillset and improves on the areas where I could be better. In a broad sense, this project will focus on areas such as Infrastructure, Networking, AI and Azure. All such areas will include resources that I am either familiar or unfamiliar with.

My initial idea for this project is to create something that touches those areas of development especially Artificial Intelligence alongside the objectives laid out in my appraisal review.

The idea for the project that I have thought is a program that would take information online from existing wikis that is related to any entertainment such as video games, TV shows or movies and turn it in to a quiz based game off the popular "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire" (WWTBAM for short).

The game would be GUI based written in python that would be picking out questions from the Wikipedia provided by the user. In this example I will be using the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe).

The program should be able to use a LLM to create sets of questions and answers that would test the user. The notable thing about the program is that it will ask about any Wikipedia page that the user enters giving it's uniqueness with the ability to use AI.
